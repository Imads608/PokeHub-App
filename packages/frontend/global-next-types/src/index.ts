// This package provides type augmentations for next-auth.
//
// HOW IT WORKS:
// The type augmentations in ./lib/next-auth.d.ts are picked up automatically
// by TypeScript when this package is referenced via the tsconfig paths.
// You do NOT need to import this package at runtime.
//
// If you're importing this package, you can remove the import - the types
// will still work as long as @pokehub/frontend/global-next-types is in tsconfig paths.

// This empty export makes this a valid ES module
export {};
