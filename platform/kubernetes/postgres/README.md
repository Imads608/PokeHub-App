NOTE: You must have Istio installed in the cluster before installing Postgres

To install PostgreSQL on Kubernetes, please run "install_postgres.sh"
This will create an Postgres instance running in the "postgres" namespace with 30 GB of space.

To connect to the instance outside the cluster, please run "expose_external.sh"
