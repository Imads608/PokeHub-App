## üèóÔ∏è Monorepo Architecture

This project is organized as an Nx monorepo with clear separation of concerns:

- `apps/pokehub-app` - Next.js frontend application
- `apps/pokehub-api` - NestJS backend API
- `packages/frontend/*` - Reusable React/Next.js components and utilities
- `packages/backend/*` - Shared NestJS modules and services
- `packages/shared/*` - Cross-platform models and types

## üö¶ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL database
- Google OAuth credentials (for authentication)

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the frontend:
```bash
nx serve pokehub-app
```

Start the backend:
```bash
nx serve pokehub-api
```

Start both together:
```bash
nx serve pokehub-app pokehub-api
```

Navigate to http://localhost:4200/ to see the app in action!


## üß™ Testing

Run all tests:
```bash
nx run-many -t test
```

Test specific projects:
```bash
nx test pokehub-app
nx test pokehub-api
nx test frontend-shared-ui-components
```

## üèóÔ∏è Building

Build for production:
```bash
nx build pokehub-app
nx build pokehub-api
```

Build all projects:
```bash
nx run-many -t build
```

## üìä Database

Push schema changes:
```bash
npx drizzle-kit push
```

Generate migrations:
```bash
npx drizzle-kit generate
```

## üéØ Project Goals

PokeHub aims to:
- Provide a modern alternative to Pokemon Showdown with improved UX
- Demonstrate best practices in monorepo architecture
- Showcase type-safe full-stack development
- Create a highly performant and scalable Pokemon battle platform
- Build a community-driven competitive Pokemon experience
